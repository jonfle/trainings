#Introduction to relational databases

##Database concepts
- **Stored procedures** are commands that can be executed to make changes or return data
- **Functions** are commapnds that can be executed to return data
- **Constraints** ensure valid values, like allowing only dates *before today* in a column
- **Primary Keys** are like SSNs. Uniquely identify a record
- **Foreign Keys** are used to create relationships between tables; refers to the column pointing to the primary key column in the other table

##Relationships
- One-to-One --> one row in table A refers to one row in table B. Not very common.
- One-to-Many --> one row in table A refers to many rows in table B. The most common.
- Many-to-Many --> many rows in table A refers to many rows in table B. Usually needs a middle table, called a "join table"

##DB Design
- Changing DB design causes headaches. Proper planning is essential, and experience is the best teacher. DBA usually does the design. 
- Normalization is a good guide for designing tables. It's a guide, not a set of rules.
    - 1st form: table has no repeating groups
    - 2nd form: if a column could uniquely identify an item, don't duplicate it
    - 3rd form: every value must only depend on the key; no calculated values
    
##Manipulating Data
1. Retrieve using *SELECT*
2. Create using *INSERT*
3. Modify using *UPDATE*
4. Delete using *DELETE*

##Result Sets vs. Row Based
- Don't use row based logic! 

##Variables
- Variable names must start with @
- Variable type establishes the data type
- Also has the value, which is the stored information. Can be NULL. 

DECLARE @<NAME> <DATATYPE>;
SET @<NAME> = <VALUE>;
