#Introduction and Fundamentals

###Views
Views are lists of tickets that are built with rules, e.g. unassigned tickets, my tickets, poor satisfaction tickets

##Macros
Macros can be set up to send pre-written responses to customers

##Triggers
Act on tickets automatically based on an event, e.g. the first "we received your message" response

##Automations
Like triggers, but time-based, e.g. a follow-up the day after the ticket is closed

##Groups 
A group in Zendesk is a collection of team members created based on meaningful attributes relevant to the workflow. Groups might be based on the type of tickets an agent will handle. The primary function of a group is ticket assignment. Every agent must be a member of at least one group.

#Questions
- How is the 'customers' page populated with users? Same question for the 'organizations' page
- What add-ons do you recommend? 
    - Curious about how to auto-generate ADO tickets based on a Zendesk tag
- What macros do we need?
