# Pillars of Being a Good Manager

## Lead by Example
- Be consistent with your principles and behaviors.
- Practice what you preach.

## Emotional Intelligence
- Be self-aware.
- Have empathy.
- Be patient with yourself.

## Accountability
- Take responsibility for your mistakes and your team's mistakes.

# Expectations and Check-ins

## Set Clear Expectations
- Explain how work will be evaluated.
- This ensures they won't be surprised if you critique something you were clear about.

## Schedule Check-ins
- Start with brief, weekly check-ins.
- Ask how they prefer to be checked in with.

# Make it Safe
- Ensure people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.
  1. Keep an open mind.
  2. Actively invite people to share their thoughts.
  3. Give trust to get trust.
  4. Support your team when they share in meetings.
  
- Allow your team to take smart risks. Use failures as teaching opportunities.

# Create Career Paths
- Be honest and clear about what you can and can't offer them.

# Listening
- Everyone's time is valuable.
- Unplug and fully engage in active listening.
  1. Put your computer away completely.
  2. Leave your phone out of the room.

To be a great listener:
- Listen for content. You should be able to recap what was said back to the speaker.
- Listen for intent. Why are they sharing what they're sharing? What do they want to get out of the conversation?
- Listen for emotion. What’s their tone and body language?

# Two-Way Communication
- Use confirmation: "I'd like to be sure I'm communicating clearly."
- Model confirmation behavior to encourage it in your team.
- Follow-up confirmation. If it's a significant conversation, ask them to email a recap later.

# Define Success
- Always explain the *why*. Give all necessary context.
- Be clear on the definition of completion, i.e., the *what*.
- Explain how the work will be evaluated. What are you looking for?

# Remove Roadblocks
Types of roadblocks:
1. **Competing priorities**: If someone isn't responding to your direct report, reach out directly or involve their manager if necessary.
2. **Lack of knowledge**: If they can't figure something out, mentor your team members to coach them through it.
3. **Financial roadblocks**: Address budgetary constraints.

# Connect with Authenticity
- The easiest thing you can do is be yourself. People can tell when you're being fake.
- Sharing about yourself helps build relationships. Don’t be a robo-boss.
- Authentic connections make the day-to-day work more enjoyable and engaging.

# Create Team and Culture
- A set of shared attitudes, values, and goals characterizes the group.
- Set core values and operating principles. What values guide decision-making? What specific behaviors do you want to see your team exhibit day-to-day?

# Authenticity, Transparency, and Vulnerability
1. **Authenticity**: Speaking your truth.
2. **Transparency**: How much information you share.
3. **Vulnerability**: How personal the information is.

- There has to be a balance.
- There's no right answer, but figure out how much vulnerability and transparency you want within your authenticity.

# Mistakes to Avoid
- **Blame vs. Ownership**: You're already accountable for your team, so blame gets you nowhere. Take ownership every time.
