## Introduction
- Your gut, no matter how many experiences you've had, is not a decision-making tool.
- A decision-making tool is something you can teach to someone else.
- A good decision tool reduces cognitive bias.
- Any decision is just a prediction of the future.
- Choose the option that gains the most ground or loses the least ground.
- Imagine what the world would look like if you made one choice or the other.

## Resulting
- It's inaccurate to determine if a decision was 'good' or 'bad' based on the outcome. The outcome does not perfectly describe the quality of the decision. This is called **Resulting**, or **Outcome Bias**—using the quality of the outcome to judge the quality of the decision.
- Example: Running a red light and getting through safely. Resulting says that was a good decision.

Consider:
- How much is the outcome clouding your judgment about the decision?
- Can you identify ways the process of making the decision could have been improved?
- What are the other options? What could have happened had you chosen differently, or would nothing have changed?

## Steps to Make Better Decisions
The biggest challenge is seeing things that are uncertain at best. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the reasonable set of possible outcomes.
2. Identify your preference using the payoff. How do you like or dislike each outcome based on your values? Define the magnitude.
   - Add 'how' good and 'how' bad. How much do you like or dislike it?
   - Define payoffs. Think in positives, negatives, and magnitudes. This should define how much you like or dislike an option.
   - Payoffs with money are one thing, but they can take many forms: time, happiness, social capital, etc.
   - Does the upside potential compensate for the risk of the potential losses?
3. Estimate the likelihood of each outcome unfolding.
4. Assess the relative likelihood of the outcomes you like and dislike for the option under consideration.
5. Repeat steps 1–4 for other options under consideration.
6. Compare the options to one another.
